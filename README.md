# OBJ Loader

This project utilizes OpenGL graphics specification to load and display `.obj` 3D model files while applying textures and lighting settings.

## Features

- **OBJ File Parsing**: The `.obj` 3D model file is parsed line by line to extract vertex data.
- **Texture Loading**: Textures are loaded using the `stb_image` library.
- **Lighting**: Implements directional lighting with support for ambient and diffuse lighting.
- **Shader Parsing**: Includes a parsing function to handle `.shader` files containing vertex and fragment shaders.
- **Camera System**: Features a camera system for movement, rotation, and zoom using linear algebra and 3D math.
